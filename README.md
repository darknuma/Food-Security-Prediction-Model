# Food-Security-Prediction-Model
<b>A RESEARCH PROJECT</b>
</br>
A Nutrition Model using Regression models.
This Prediction Model Focused on Using Food Utlization stability as the scope. It focused on using Prevalence of Undernourshment as the dependent feature agains 11 Features.
The scope was Limited to Nigeria  population in millions. 

Data was collected from FAOSTAT database. 

And Regression Models was applied.


EDIT EDIT
 
 The model was Updated to undergo various approach of Feature Engineering and Selection of the Models based on 
 3 Feature Selections that sets them as predictor factors.
 
 The Final Model is in the FSPM(corrected Model).ipynb
